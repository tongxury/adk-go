// Instruction 3 is what keeps tail retention usable. Under tail retention each
// summary is seeded with the previous one, so a value stated early is
// recompressed on every pass. Without an instruction to carry values forward,
// a pass tends to keep the label and drop the value -- "the deployment region"
// in place of "europe-west4" -- and once generalized it cannot come back,
// because the next pass sees only the previous summary and the retained tail.
// Measured over ten conversations that each ran ten or more passes, the prompt
// without instruction 3 lost every early detail in five of them; with it, none
// of nine lost any. See the package doc, "What bounding costs".
//
// It asks only for what the user stated, which is narrower than the problem.
// Identifiers that arrive in a tool response decay the same way, and for a
// tool-using agent that is where most of them come from. The boundary is
// deliberate rather than considered sufficient: the measurement behind this
// covers user-stated values, and tool output is already the bulkiest part of a
// transcript, so instructing the model to carry it forward verbatim would
// enlarge every subsequent summary by an amount nothing here has measured.
// Widening it wants its own change and its own numbers.
//
// One consequence worth naming: the instruction argues against dropping
// anything that looks like a durable fact, including text that arrived inside a
// tool response. Content injected there used to decay out of a rolling summary
// within a few passes and now has a prompt arguing for its retention. It cannot
// forge a turn -- formatEvents escapes newlines, so a tool response cannot
// impersonate a speaker -- but it can persist longer than it used to.

//     summary cut off at the first occurrence of the token is stored and the
//     covered turns are then dropped in favour of it.
