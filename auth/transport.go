// via a [CredentialProvider] and applies it to the outgoing request headers.

// The provider receives the request context (req.Context()), which — for a
// request made during a tool call — descends from the ADK context that flowed
// into the call. The resolver runs on every request so that per-user
// credentials are never shared across users. Refresh and caching belong to the
// provider: a token-source-backed one refreshes itself, and a network-backed one
// can cache in a [CredentialStore].
