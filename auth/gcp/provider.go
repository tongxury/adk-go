	// the production endpoints. That adds two failure modes to Credential, since
	// the build can fail or exceed its 30s bound. Pass a [Client] from
	// [NewClient] to reach another endpoint or to tune the poll timeout — note
	// that this trades the lazy path away: unless the Client carries its own
	// HTTPClient, [NewClient] discovers Application Default Credentials
	// synchronously, so the cost and any failure move to startup, where they can
	// at least be reported.

	// Store caches resolved credentials across requests. When nil, a private
	// in-memory store is used. Caching matters here because each miss is a
	// network round-trip (and up to a ~10s pending poll) to the credential
	// service.
	//
	// One store can safely back several providers: entries are keyed by the app,
	// the end user, and everything that decides what the service returns — the
	// resource, the scopes, the continue URI, and the Client. Two providers share
	// an entry when they share a Client and agree on all of that, and not
	// otherwise. Building a Client per provider is therefore a way to get no
	// sharing at all; see [Config.HTTPClient].
	//
	// A Client is identified per process, so a store shared across processes or
	// replicas never serves one process's entry to another: each reads back only
	// what it wrote. That discloses nothing and costs a round trip per process,
	// but it also means a store backed by something shared buys no hits across
	// replicas.
	//
	// The cost of caching is staleness. A credential revoked before it expires
	// keeps being served until the cached entry does, which is the service's
	// expiry or an hour, whichever comes first. To invalidate one sooner, pass
	// [Client.CacheKey] to [auth.CredentialStore.Delete] — which needs a Client,
	// so set one here rather than leaving it to the lazy default if you intend to
	// invalidate at all. The provider does not expose the Client it builds for

// attempt, which keeps running — a later call may well succeed.
//
// That holds for a lookup that eventually returns. One that never does is
// terminal: the attempt is cleared only when it finishes, so this provider keeps
// exactly one for the rest of the process and every later call fails here
// immediately. Retiring a running attempt instead would start a fresh
// uncancellable lookup on a timer, which is worse, so this is the deliberate
// trade rather than an oversight.
//
// The count is per provider, not per process — pending is a provider field. Build
// the provider once at wiring time and one hung lookup costs one parked
// goroutine. Build one per request and the cost is per request.

// which raises on a missing user id rather than degrading the turn.
var ErrNoActingUser = errors.New("gcp: no acting user")

// defaultInitTimeout bounds how long a caller waits for the default client. The
// build itself cannot be bounded by a context — FindDefaultCredentials reads the

// on the waiting side.
const defaultInitTimeout = 30 * time.Second

// NewProvider returns an [auth.CredentialProvider] that resolves credentials for
// cfg.Scheme via the Agent Identity / IAM Connector services.
//
// The acting user is taken from the ADK context ([agent.IdentityFromContext]) at
// resolve time, so the provider must run within an agent invocation. Three
// requirements then fall on the transport that carries the authenticated
// requests and on the context they run under, none of which this package can
// enforce:
//
//   - Every request must descend from the invoking user's context. A transport
//     that shares one connection across invocations does not qualify —
//     mcptoolset included: its per-call POSTs are per-user, but the MCP session
//     and the standalone server-to-client stream are opened on the context of
//     whichever user connected first and stay bound to it.
//   - The transport must not follow a cross-host redirect. net/http strips
//     Authorization above the RoundTripper, so [auth.Transport] re-resolves and
//     re-applies the end user's credential to the redirect target. Set
//     CheckRedirect on the http.Client that carries the transport. The
//     ADC-backed client [NewClient] builds for itself does the same.
//   - Requests must run under a context ADK derived, and an
//     agent.InvocationContext or agent.Context implemented outside the ADK module
//     must override every method on those interfaces that returns one of them.
//     Otherwise it is dropped by its own promoted methods and the credential is
//     minted for the invocation it wraps. Deriving it is necessary and is not
//     sufficient on its own: agent.Run applies a delta on every run, and the
//     workflow schedulers call WithAgentCancel and WithAgentTimeout on the
//     context a node was handed.
//     [agent.IdentityFromContext] states the limits in full.
//
// Wiring this up also means trusting the embedding server: ADK does not
// authenticate session.UserID, and it now decides whose credential is minted.
//
// Resolved credentials are cached in [ProviderConfig.Store], under the key
// described there, until the service's expiry or an hour, whichever comes
// first. Only a miss reaches the credential service, at the cost of a retrieval
// plus any pending poll. A credential revoked before it expires therefore keeps
// being served until its entry does, unless the entry is deleted through
// [Client.CacheKey].
//
// ctx is used only to build the default client, and only for its values. Its
