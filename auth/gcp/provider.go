	// [NewClient] to reach another endpoint or to tune the poll timeout — note
	// that this trades the lazy path away: unless the Client carries its own

// ErrClientUnavailable means the default Application Default Credentials client
// is not available: discovery failed, or it did not finish inside the bound. The
// lookup is not cancellable, so that bound is on the wait rather than on the
// attempt, which keeps running — a later call may well succeed.
//
// That holds for a lookup that eventually returns. One that never does is
// terminal: the attempt is cleared only when it finishes, so this provider keeps
// exactly one for the rest of the process and every later call fails here
// immediately. Retiring a running attempt instead would start a fresh
// uncancellable lookup on a timer, which is worse, so this is the deliberate
// trade rather than an oversight.

// request, the Go provider fails the request: no user, no credential.
var ErrNoActingUser = errors.New("gcp: no acting user")

// defaultInitTimeout bounds how long a caller waits for the default client. The
// build itself cannot be bounded by a context — FindDefaultCredentials reads the

// on the waiting side.
const defaultInitTimeout = 30 * time.Second

// NewProvider returns an [auth.CredentialProvider] that resolves credentials for
// cfg.Scheme via the Agent Identity / IAM Connector services.
//
// The acting user is taken from the ADK context ([agent.IdentityFromContext]) at
// resolve time, so the provider must run within an agent invocation. Three
// requirements then fall on the transport that carries the authenticated
// requests and on the context they run under, none of which this package can
// enforce:
//
//   - Every request must descend from the invoking user's context. A transport
//     that shares one connection across invocations does not qualify —
//     mcptoolset included: its per-call POSTs are per-user, but the MCP session
//     and the standalone server-to-client stream are opened on the context of
//     whichever user connected first and stay bound to it.
//   - The transport must not follow a cross-host redirect. net/http strips
//     Authorization above the RoundTripper, so [auth.Transport] re-resolves and
//     re-applies the end user's credential to the redirect target. Set
//     CheckRedirect on the http.Client that carries the transport. The
//     ADC-backed client [NewClient] builds for itself does the same.
//   - Requests must run under a context ADK derived, and an
//     agent.InvocationContext or agent.Context implemented outside the ADK module
//     must override every method on those interfaces that returns one of them.
//     Otherwise it is dropped by its own promoted methods and the credential is
//     minted for the invocation it wraps. Deriving it is necessary and is not
//     sufficient on its own: agent.Run applies a delta on every run, and the
//     workflow schedulers call WithAgentCancel and WithAgentTimeout on the
//     context a node was handed.
//     [agent.IdentityFromContext] states the limits in full.
//
// Wiring this up also means trusting the embedding server: ADK does not
// authenticate session.UserID, and it now decides whose credential is minted.
//
// ctx is used only to build the default client, and only for its values. Its
// cancellation is not honored, because that client outlives any one request.
// Pass the process-scoped context the rest of the app is wired with, not a
