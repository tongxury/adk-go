// Package gcp resolves per-user Google Cloud credentials from the Agent Identity
// and IAM Connector credential services. Given a resource name it retrieves an
// end-user credential and maps it to an [auth.Credential], polling while the
// service reports a non-interactive "pending" state and surfacing interactive
// consent as an [auth.ConsentRequiredError].
//
// [NewProvider] is the entry point for an agent: it returns an
// [auth.CredentialProvider] that takes the acting user from the invocation
// context, so a tool's outbound requests are authenticated as the end user.
// [NewClient] is the transport underneath, usable on its own where the caller
// already knows the user.
//
// No generated Go client libraries exist for these (preview) services and their
// surface is a single RPC, so the client is hand-rolled over net/http to keep
// dependencies light. Calls to the credential services are authenticated with
// Application Default Credentials (cloud-platform scope) unless a custom
// *http.Client is supplied.
