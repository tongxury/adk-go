// Package auth provides a small, idiomatic authentication layer for ADK Go.
//
// It models the two things a consumer actually needs: a resolved [Credential]
// that knows how to write itself onto an outbound HTTP request, and a
// [CredentialProvider] seam that resolves a credential for the current
// invocation. Built-in providers cover the common cases — a static bearer
// token ([StaticToken]), a header API key ([APIKey]), any
// [golang.org/x/oauth2.TokenSource] ([TokenSourceProvider]), Application
// Default Credentials ([ADC]), and service accounts ([ServiceAccount]) — and a
// context-aware [Transport] applies a provider per outgoing request.
//
// A provider that has to reach the network to resolve a credential can cache
// what it resolved in a [CredentialStore], keyed per app, per end user, and per
// whatever else decides which credential comes back; [InMemoryCredentialStore]
// is the process-local implementation. Providers backed by a token source
// refresh themselves and need none.
//
// Token exchange and refresh are delegated to golang.org/x/oauth2 rather than
// reimplemented here. Heavier, provider-specific integrations (for example GCP
// agent identity) live in subpackages so this package stays dependency-light.
