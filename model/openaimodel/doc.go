// Package openaimodel provides a client for interacting with OpenAI's API.
//
// EXPERIMENTAL: This package is experimental and its behavior may change or be
// removed in the future.
//
// It implements the model.LLM interface against either of OpenAI's two HTTP
// APIs, selected by [ClientConfig.API]:
//
//	[APIResponses]        POST /v1/responses, the default
//	[APIChatCompletions]  POST /v1/chat/completions, the surface most
//	                      OpenAI-compatible third-party providers implement
//
// Every top-level field of genai.GenerateContentConfig is either translated or
// rejected with an error naming it, the pre-existing errors being checked first
// so existing errors.Is call sites are unaffected. Rejection keys on presence,
// which is only observable where the zero value cannot itself be a setting, so
// a plain bool or string carrying its zero — AudioTimestamp false, CachedContent
// or MediaResolution empty — passes unremarked, as does HTTPOptions.Headers,
// ignored by design because headers addressed to another backend must not reach
// OpenAI.
//
// The two APIs do not translate the same set, because they do not accept the
// same fields:
//
//	Both        Temperature, TopP, MaxOutputTokens, SystemInstruction,
//	            ResponseMIMEType, ResponseSchema, ResponseJsonSchema,
//	            ResponseLogprobs with Logprobs, Tools, ToolConfig,
//	            ThinkingConfig, ServiceTier, HTTPOptions.Timeout
//	Chat only   StopSequences, FrequencyPenalty, PresencePenalty, Seed
//	Rejected    TopK, CandidateCount above one, Labels, SafetySettings, an
//	            unsupported ResponseMIMEType, CachedContent, ResponseModalities,
//	            MediaResolution, SpeechConfig, AudioTimestamp, ImageConfig,
//	            RoutingConfig, ModelSelectionConfig, ModelArmorConfig,
//	            EnableEnhancedCivicAnswers, AudioTranscriptionConfig,
//	            ContinuationToken, HTTPOptions apart from Timeout and Headers,
//	            and on Responses also StopSequences, the penalties and Seed
//	Ignored     HTTPOptions.Headers, and on Chat Completions
//	            ThinkingConfig.IncludeThoughts, which has no equivalent there
//
// Function tools are sent with strict parameter validation disabled, and that
// is not configurable, so tool call arguments are best effort rather than
// guaranteed to match the declared parameter schema.
//
// On the Responses API, model reasoning is reported to the caller as thought
// parts; Chat Completions responses are read for text, refusals and tool calls
// only. Reasoning is not sent back on a later turn to either API: the
// Responses API accepts it only as an input item referencing the id of the
// item that produced it, which ADK does not carry, and Chat Completions has no
// field for it. Reasoning therefore informs the turn that produced it and no
// other; a caller that needs a conclusion to survive should have the model
// state it in the answer. What this package cannot police is reasoning that
// something upstream has already rendered as ordinary text: a peer agent's
// reply folded into context, a compacted transcript, or a memory recall all
// arrive with the thought marker gone, and reach every model package alike.
//
// Clients construct a ClientConfig and pass it to NewModel:
//
//	ctx := context.Background()
//	cfg := &openaimodel.ClientConfig{APIKey: os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}
//	llm, err := openaimodel.NewModel(ctx, openai.ChatModelGPT4oMini, cfg)
//	if err != nil {
//		log.Fatal(err)
//	}
//
// Selecting the Chat Completions API is one more field:
//
//	cfg := &openaimodel.ClientConfig{
//		APIKey: os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
//		API:    openaimodel.APIChatCompletions,
//	}
//
// Setting BaseURL points either API at another OpenAI-compatible provider that
// serves it. Make sure APIKey is non-empty when BaseURL points at another
// provider. The OpenAI client falls back to the OPENAI_API_KEY environment
// variable when it is empty, and would send that key to BaseURL.
