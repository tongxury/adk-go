// Identity is an ADK invocation's identity: the acting user, app name, and
// session a call belongs to. It is recovered from a plain context.Context via
// [IdentityFromContext], which reads it off the live session each time rather
// than caching it.
//
// Reading it live is not licence to mutate the session from elsewhere. The
// lookup runs on whatever goroutine asks — inside an http.RoundTripper, that is
// the caller's — while [session.Session] states no goroutine-safety requirement
// on ID, AppName and UserID. A session that rewrites those three after the
// invocation starts must be safe for concurrent reads, or the credential path
// races it.
//
// Concurrency-safe is necessary and not sufficient, and the gap is the one an
// implementer falls into. The read binds one [session.Session] and then makes
// three separate accessor calls on it, so a session that guards each accessor
// with a mutex has met "safe for concurrent reads" exactly and can still hand
// back an Identity whose three fields name two different generations — a user
// against another's app and session. What is required is a consistent triple
// across three consecutive calls on one Session value. Fixing all three at
// construction gives you that, and is what ADK's own sessions do.
//
// Build one with keyed fields. Fields may be added, and an unkeyed literal stops
// compiling when they are — Go's compatibility promise permits the addition and
// does not cover the literal.

// IdentityFromContext returns the ADK invocation [Identity] carried by ctx, if

//
// ADK contexts embed context.Context and register their identity under a private
// key, so code that only holds a context.Context — for example an
// http.RoundTripper running deep beneath a tool call, past intermediaries that
// wrap the context — can recover the acting identity without threading a typed
// context through every layer.
//
// Read this before acting on the result: it establishes which invocation a
// context was DERIVED from, and is trusted only as far as every wrapper between
// it and that invocation is. It is NOT an authentication boundary and cannot be
// made into one. ok does not rule out the answer belonging to an ENCLOSING
// invocation: an [InvocationContext] implemented outside the module, passed as
// the context itself, reports the invocation it embeds rather than its own
// session. The rule below says exactly when, and why closing it is not possible
// here.
//
// It returns (zero, false) and never panics. Several different things produce
// that answer and none is distinguishable from the others here — a context that
// does not descend from an ADK context, an invocation with no readable session, a
// nil ctx, an intermediary in the chain whose Value panics, a context answering
// the key with something that is not an [Identity]. The list is not closed, and
// callers must not treat "false" as naming any one of them. A panic is contained
// rather than propagated, because this runs where net/http does not recover. ok does not imply a populated Identity either: an
// invocation whose session carries no user yields an empty UserID, so a caller
// that needs one must check.
//
// An invocation ADK itself built reports its own user however a context is
// derived from it, with one exception that applies in-module too: [Context.WithContext]
// and [Context.WithAgentContext] rebind to the argument when handed an
// [InvocationContext] rather than a plain context.Context, so the result reports
// the ARGUMENT's user by design. That case is set out below. An
// [InvocationContext] implemented OUTSIDE the module is where the rest stops, and
// one rule covers every way it does.
//
// Such a type is a decorator over the invocation it embeds, and Go promotes
// every method it does not override. Every method on [InvocationContext] and
// [Context] that RETURNS one of them returns the receiver's own derived copy, so
// a promoted one hands back the EMBEDDED invocation and the decorator is gone —
// its session with it. That is not confined to the identity: Session, UserID and
// AppName then report the enclosing invocation too.
//
// Promotion also reaches what a method HANDS BACK, which matters most where the
// thing handed back carries a user. A decorator that overrides Session but not
// [Context.Artifacts], [Context.Memory] or [Context.SearchMemory] gets handles
// built for the enclosing invocation, and those carry AppName, UserID and
// SessionID as the storage and search keys — SearchMemory by way of the Memory
// handle it reaches through. So such a context can answer this function with its
// own user while reading and writing the ENCLOSING user's artifacts and
// memories.
//
// [Context.State], [ReadonlyContext.ReadonlyState] and [Context.Actions] are the
// same shape by a different route: each resolves through the invocation the
// context holds rather than through Session, so a promoted one reads and writes
// the enclosing user's session state, and a promoted Actions accumulates into
// the event actions that commit to that user's session. Override all six, or
// accept that only the credential follows the decorator. That behaviour predates
// the identity key and is unchanged by it — Session, UserID and AppName have
// always reported the enclosing invocation on the same shape — but a decorator
// author reading this rule needs to know the credential is not the only thing
// scoped to a user.
//
// So an invocation written outside the module reports its own user only where it
// answers for itself:
//
//   - Derive it — [Promote], [NewContext], [NewToolContext], [NewCallbackContext],
//     [NewCallbackContextWithArtifactTracking], a readonly context — and the
//     derived context reports its user, or none at all if it has no readable
//     session.
//
//     Passing it *as the context itself* is different, and what happens depends
//     on what its own Value does. Leave Value alone and its parent answers, so
//     the enclosing invocation is reported: the key is unnameable outside the
//     module, so the decorator cannot claim it. Implement Value and there are two
//     cases. Answer with something that is not an [Identity] and nothing is
//     reported. Answer with an [Identity] — built directly, or taken from the
//     parent's answer and substituted — and that is what this function reports.
//     Naming the key is required for neither.
//
//     Nor is the key itself out of reach, which is worth being exact about
//     because the internal package's own doc once claimed otherwise. Its TYPE is
//     unnameable outside the google.golang.org/adk/v2 import-path tree — Go scopes
//     internal/ by import path and not by module, so a separate module published
//     under that prefix is inside the boundary — but this function hands the key VALUE to
//     whatever Value implementation ctx provides, so a single call is enough for
//     that implementation to keep it and later plant an [Identity] under it with
//     context.WithValue — from a context descending from no invocation at all,
//     on another goroutine, after the call it observed has ended.
//
//     So: this function establishes which invocation a context was DERIVED from,
//     and it is exactly as trustworthy as every wrapper between it and that
//     invocation. It is not an authentication boundary and cannot be made into
//     one — any in-process code that can wrap a context can already lie about
//     Session and UserID, and a caller needing a guarantee against in-process
//     code needs a different mechanism.
//
//   - Call a context-producing method ON it and it is dropped, promoting or not,
//     because the promoted method belongs to what it embeds. It must override
//     every one of them, returning a derived copy of ITSELF. The rule is the
//     return type, not the list: as of writing that is
//     [InvocationContext.WithContext] and [InvocationContext.WithICDelta] on
//     [InvocationContext], plus [Context.WithDelta], [Context.WithAgentContext],
//     [Context.WithAgentTimeout] and [Context.WithAgentCancel] on [Context].
//     There is no exception here: a direct call drops it whatever the delta
//     says, including one carrying no [InvocationContextDelta] at all, because
//     the promoted method never reaches the decorator to consult the delta.
//
//   - Promoting it first shelters it from three of those four. [Promote] holds
//     the decorator in a commonContext, and WithAgentContext, WithAgentTimeout
//     and WithAgentCancel re-parent only the context.Context above it, so the
//     decorator still answers. WithDelta is the exception: it forwards to the
//     held invocation's WithICDelta, so it drops the decorator through the
//     promotion, exactly as [PromoteWithDelta] does. Both reach WithICDelta and
//     neither reaches WithDelta, so overriding WithICDelta alone is enough for
//     them — it is a direct call on the decorator that WithDelta must also cover.
//     This is the one place a delta carrying no [InvocationContextDelta] is
//     genuinely safe: held inside a commonContext, such a delta leaves the
//     invocation untouched. Held is the operative word, and it is why the
//     exception belongs here and not above.
//
// Two further things a decorator cannot fix by overriding the methods above:
//
//   - [Context.WithContext], and [Context.WithAgentContext] it delegates to,
//     rebind the invocation when handed an [InvocationContext] rather than a
//     plain context.Context. The result then reports the ARGUMENT's user, by
//     design and whoever the receiver spoke for. It is the one derivation that
//     legitimately changes who a context speaks for, so do not hand it another
//     call's invocation. How MUCH it rebinds then depends on whether the
//     receiver cached an artifacts handle. Over an invocation that has an
//     artifact service, a tool or tracking callback context caches one and
//     carries it across untouched, so the result answers for the argument while
//     Artifacts() still addresses the receiver's user — the same split as the
//     promotion case above, reached the other way round. Over an invocation with
//     none, nothing is cached, Artifacts() falls through to the invocation, and
//     the rebind takes that with it. Both are pinned, because the second only
//     became possible when the constructors started returning a nil handle
//     rather than a wrapper around one.
//   - [Context.SubScheduler] returns a scheduler, not a context, so the
//     return-type rule above does not reach it — but the scheduler captured the
//     context it was built from and derives every child from that. A decorator
//     that does not override it hands back the embedded context's scheduler, and
//     workflow.RunNode asks for one on entry, so the whole child subtree then
//     runs as the enclosing invocation. Overriding SubScheduler does not repair
//     it, because [DynamicSubScheduler.RunNode] takes no context and the one the
//     scheduler captured is unexported — so the override has nothing to rebind.
//     Closing it means changing the workflow engine, not this package.
//
// None of this is avoidable by discipline alone — [agent.Run] applies a delta on
// every run, and the workflow schedulers call WithAgentCancel and
// WithAgentTimeout on the context a node was handed.
