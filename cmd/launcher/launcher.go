	// BindHost is the address the server is bound to, as the web launcher
	// resolved it from -host. A loopback value arms the Host check in
	// [adkrest.ServerConfig.BindHost], which refuses a rebound page's
	// same-origin GET: a browser sends no Origin on one, so Host is the only
	// thing that gives it away.
	//
	// Empty means no bind was declared and that check stays off.
	BindHost string

	// AllowedOrigins lists the web origins allowed to call the web launcher's
	// server from a browser, as scheme://host[:port]; a bare host or host:port
	// is read as http. A "*" entry turns off both checks described here.
	//
	// The web launcher checks every request against one policy, built from
	// this list once every sublauncher is set up. A cross-origin browser
	// request from an origin not on the list is refused with 403. A
	// same-origin one is served, unless its Origin is not a loopback address
	// and the server serves only this machine: BindHost is a loopback
	// address, or a wildcard one such as 0.0.0.0 and the connection was
	// accepted on loopback. Such a server serves loopback pages, so a page
	// claiming to be elsewhere got there by rebinding its DNS name. A reverse
	// proxy on the same machine is refused the same way, so list its origin.
	//
	// When BindHost is a loopback address, a request whose Host is neither
	// loopback nor the host of a listed origin is refused too, whether or not
	// it carries an Origin, which is what stops a DNS-rebinding page. On any
	// other bind that check is off, so a rebound page's requests that carry no
	// Origin get through. So do the rest, unless BindHost is a wildcard
	// address and the connection was accepted on loopback. Inside a container
	// behind a published port, it is accepted on a routable address. The
	// Authenticator then protects the REST API alone; the other routes, A2A
	// among them, have no authentication.
	//
	// A caller may set it, the web launcher's -allow_origins flag appends to
	// it, and a sublauncher appends the origins it serves, such as the web UI
	// origin, in SetupSubrouters. A sublauncher sees only the entries added
	// before its own SetupSubrouters runs, and that is the list anything it
	// builds from this field is given.

	// Authorizer provides a way to check whether the calling user and user from payload match.
	// You can leave nil if you accept any combination. You will get [authz.Noop] as a default.

	// user from the payload are matching exactly
	Authorizer authz.Authorizer

	// Compaction enables context compaction for the sessions the
	// runners created here drive, replacing older events with summaries. Nil,
	// the default, disables compaction.
	//
	// The sliding window reduces prompt size by a constant factor rather than
	// bounding it. Only tail retention bounds growth, and it only fires when
	// more events accumulate between sliding-window compactions than
	// EventRetentionSize holds back, so a short interval with a large retention
	// size leaves it idle. See [compaction.Config].
	//
	// This setting is process-wide. One launcher can serve many applications
	// through its agent loader, and they all get this config or none of them
	// do, including the same Summarizer instance and so the same model. If
	// different applications need different compaction, or must not share a
	// summarizer, run them separately.

	// MaxPayloadSize limits the REST API server's request body size in bytes.
	// The web launcher sets it from its -max_request_body_size flag, and a
	// value set by an embedder is honored. The same limit is applied to the
	// base router and the ADK REST API sublauncher. If <= 0, the adkrest
	// default (10 MiB) is used.
